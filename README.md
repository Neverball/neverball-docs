# Making Neverball Levels

Herein lies the mapping documentation for Neverball. This is still very much a work in progress, so a lot of the information presented here is out of date. On the bright side, it is getting updated. If you're interested in making custom Neverball levels or Neverputt holes, getting here is half the battle. Good luck!
