#Setup

##Setting the level editor on Windows

First, you need a working copy of Neverball on your computer. I highly recommend the latest build [1] since it allows you to use rotating objects, which are not possible to show up in the last stable released version (1.5.4).

Second, you need NetRadiant [2]. This program is a 3D editor that is used by all those who want to map levels for Neverball to draw geometry, paint it by using textures and add entities such as balls, switches, linkers and  so on. Installing it requires only a few steps.

* Download all the needed resources and extract somewhere your Neverball folder and your NetRadiant folder.
* If you grabbed NetRadiant using the resource [2], the Neverball Pack is already included, otherwise you can find a copy of it in your Neverball installation folder. Make sure you have in your NetRadiant installation a folder named ‘neverball.game’ and in the /games folder a file named ‘neverball.game’.
* Aero causes a few problems to the program, so you might want to turn it off. To achieve this, right click on the executable file ‘radiant.exe’ which you can find in your NetRadiant installation folder, click on ‘Properties’, switch to the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the ‘disable desktop compositions’ box.
* In the same box, check the ‘use this program as an administrator’ box.
* Launch radiant.exe by double-clicking on it and choose Neverball as your default game. If asked, specify your engine folder (The path that you installed Neverball in).
* Enjoy your mapping environment!
